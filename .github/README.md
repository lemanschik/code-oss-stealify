# A Open CodeSwing Fork without Microsoft
CodeSwing is a good idea in general and it implements the FileSystem Provider and other Workspace API's 
in a user frindly way the only problem is that it is Microsoft Centric so using Open Ai Github and all that 

this version fixes that it allows to be used with other git / gist providers as also local LLM Deployments 
or Antrhropic Claude and so on. 

It uses Web RTC as Main workaround to exchange data cross context. 

This is designed to get developed in conjunction with the overall effort of unlicense-code and code-oss where code-oss-web is the main 
part that benefits from this. 

the revision saving via git or gist is also a keypoint as it allows fast iteration without the fear of loosing working state.
