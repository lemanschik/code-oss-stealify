# A Open CodeSwing Fork without Microsoft
CodeSwing is a good idea in general and it implements the FileSystem Provider and other Workspace API's 
in a user frindly way the only problem is that it is Microsoft Centric so using Open Ai Github and all that 

this version fixes that it allows to be used with other git / gist providers as also local LLM Deployments 
or Antrhropic Claude and so on. 

It uses Web RTC as Main workaround to exchange data cross context.
